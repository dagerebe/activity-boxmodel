        <h1>Dwarf Hamsters</h1>
        
        <p><strong>Dwarf hamsters are super cute and about half the size of a regular Syrian hamster. They have cheek pouches where they stuff their food and you’ll often see them stuffing their cheeks full, giving the impression that their head is much larger than their body.</strong></p>

        <h2>Types of Dwarf Hamsters</h2>
        
        <h3>Roborovski Dwarf Hamster</h3>
        
        <p>The Roborovski dwarf hamster or robo dwarf hamster is the smallest hamster species kept as pets. It measures less than 3 inches even in adulthood. In the wild, robo dwarf hamsters can be found in the deserts of Russia, Kazakhstan, and northern China. They eat grains, vegetables, fruit, as well as insects and meat in small amounts.
Robo dwarf hamsters are fast and very active. When you visit a pet shop with robos, you’ll often find them running on the wheel. In fact, they have been known to run as much as four human marathons on average every night. That’s more than a hundred miles!
A robo dwarf hamster is usually grayish-brown with a white underbelly. There is also a type that has a completely white face and is sometimes referred to as a Husky robo or a white-face robo. Unlike other dwarf hamsters, robos don’t have dorsal stripes.
The average lifespan of a robo dwarf hamster kept as a pet is 3 years, although they have been known to live up to 4.
Robo dwarf hamsters can be bred at four months for females and three months for males. The gestation period is 22 to 30 days and usually four to six pups are produced.</p>
        
        <h3>Russian Dwarf Hamster</h3>
        
        <p>Russian dwarf hamsters can refer to the Winter White or Campbell’s dwarf hamster. The two appear very similar and are often confused with each other. In fact, scientists have classified them as the same species for many years. The term “fancy Russian dwarf hamster” simply refers to Russian dwarf hamsters that are attractively colored.<strong>Winter white dwarf hamsters</strong>, also known as the Djungarian hamster, winter white hamster or Siberian hamster, are 3 to 4 inches long in adulthood. The name “winter white”, comes from the ability of these hamsters to change color from dark gray to white in the wild during winter. Pet winter whites do not usually turn white in the house due to artificial lighting/heat in the house.
Other than dark gray with dorsal stripes and a white belly, winter whites also come in pearl, sapphire, sapphire pearl, and marbled.
In the wild, the winter white dwarf hamster can be found in Siberia, Russia, and Central Asia. They can live for as little as one year in the wild, but the average lifespan of a pet winter white is usually one to three years.
Winter whites can be bred at 4 to 6 months old and have a gestation period of 18 to 25 days. Usually 4 to 8 pups are born although there have been instances where there are up to 14 pups in a litter.Campbell’s dwarf hamsters are the other Russian dwarf hamster and are the most common dwarf hamsters found in pet stores. They are very similar to winter whites in appearance.<strong>Campell’s dwarf hamsters</strong> can be found in the wild in Russia, China, and other parts of Central Asia. As pets, they can live for 2 to 2.5 years but have a shorter lifespan in the wild.
Campbell’s should be bred at three months or later and have a gestation period of 18 to 20 days. A Campbell dwarf hamster can have up to 10 pups in a litter.</p>
        
        <h3>Hybrid Dwarf Hamsters</h3>
        
        <p>Hybrid dwarf hamsters are bred from winter whites and Campbell’s dwarf hamsters. They are usually bred for their attractive colors such as orange, pudding, or brown but are prone to numerous health problems. Due to this and other ethical issues, crossbreeding the two Russian dwarf hamsters to produce hybrids is controversial.</p>
        
        <h3>Chinese Dwarf Hamsters</h3>
        
        <p>The correct term for this hamster would be the Chinese hamster although they are commonly mistaken for dwarf hamsters due to their size and possibly their black dorsal stripe. Chinese hamsters are not related to the other dwarf hamsters mentioned above. Unlike dwarf hamsters which have really small and flatter tails, Chinese “dwarf hamsters” also have longer and thinner tails.</p>

        <h2>Things to note when buying a hamster</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Make sure your hamster is healthy.</strong> The dwarf hamster should have clear eyes and nose, and no bald patches or scabs on its skin.</li>
            <li><strong>Don’t buy from the same cage (or even store) if ANY hamster has wet tail.</strong> This is an infectious disease that is fatal to hamsters. If any of the hamsters in the cage has wet tail, the others are already at risk of getting it even if they look healthy for now.</li>
            <li><strong>Look for a younger hamster.</strong> Your dwarf hamster only lives an average of 2 – 2.5 years so you want a hamster that will be with you for a longer time</li>
            <li><strong>Determine the gender of your hamster.</strong> Many people pick a hamster at random and have trouble identifying its gender later when they’re trying to name it. Ask an employee at the store to determine the gender of your new pet so you don’t have to worry about it later. Note: This is not 100% foolproof, sometimes the hamster is too young for you to determine its gender immediately, or the employee might just get it wrong.</li>
